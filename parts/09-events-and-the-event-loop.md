## Events

- Events are actions or occurrences that happen in the
  system you are programming, which the system tells you
  about so you can respond to them as needed.

- The system will give a signal when an event occurs, so
  that the appropriate response (that is, a callback
  function) is taken.

- As we're programming, we have no way of knowing when
  events will occur â€“ working with events is therefore
  working with _asynchronous_ code.

- An **Event Handler** is a callback function that will be
  called when an event is triggered.
