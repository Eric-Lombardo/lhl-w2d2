## Synchronous JavaScript

- Until today, we've been working with synchronous JS.
  This means our code gets executed in order, in a 'single
  thread.'

- We looked at an example of ordering food at a
  restaurant. Preparing the food synchronously means
  someone might have to wait a really long time to get
  their order.

- In such a case, the execution is **blocked** until the
  computation is completed. To users, it may look like the
  program is **hanging** and unresponsive.

- One possible solution to this problem is to use
  asynchronous code instead.
